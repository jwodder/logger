- Add a manpage (See the list of options at the end of the program)

- Commands to handle:
 - KILL
 - INVITE (just metalog)
- Improve handling of NOTICEs
- Handle 328 and 333 replies
- Should the [=*@] character in NAMES replies be recorded somehow?
- Detect login failure arising at the PASS and/or USER stages
- Handle servers that disconnect (via an ERROR message) at inappropriate times
  (including while logging in) and incorporate this feature into listchans.pl
 - When an ERROR message is received while in the main loop, log it to any
   channels still listed in %chans (and then delete them?).
- Should tabs be allowed in channel names?
- Handle instructions to "JOIN 0"
- Try to improve the formats of metalogged messages
 - It seems that metalogged messages can be divided into the following
   categories:
  - raw messages
   - NOTICE - change to "NOTICE from $sender: $text" ?
   - ERROR
   - error replies
  - UNKNOWN messages
  - marginally-rephrased messages (WALLOPS, self-MODE, etc.)
  - server messages
   - logs of control commands
  - logged direct PRIVMSGs (logged as raw)
   - change to "PRIVMSG from $sender: $text" ?

- Add a control command for changing the bot's NICK
- Add a control command for making the bot rotate logfiles
- Add a control command to make the bot send a given message to a given channel
  or user (useful for proving who controls it)
- Make the STATS command make the bot send back how many messages it's seen in
  each channel?
- Should the bot automatically quit if it PARTs from all channels?

- Add a way to pass the control password (and other parameters?) to the script
  from a file
- Allow $longmode to be specified as a hex, octal, or binary(?) number
- Complain about invalid -N and -L arguments
- Convert the list of options into a POD manpage
- Define &HELP_MESSAGE
- Print a usage message when an invalid option is supplied on the command line
- How should -P arguments containing spaces be handled?

- Rewrite the code to use Perl 5.10's "given" syntax?
- Incorporate most of the security improvements (mainly involving command-line
  options) into listchans.pl
- Make the script detach itself from the terminal automatically?
